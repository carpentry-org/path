# path

is a simple file path library for Carp.

## Installation

```clojure
(load "https://veitheller.de/git/carpentry/path@0.0.2")
```

### Usage

The `Path` module mostly operates on `String` arguments. It allows you to
split, join, and merge paths and extensions in a lot of different ways. It also
has some functions to work with the `PATH` environment variable.

It assumes either Windows or POSIX-style separators.

Look at [the documentation](https://veitheller.de/path) for more information.
